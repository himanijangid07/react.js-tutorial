Hydration : Jab pehli baar page load hota hai, buttons aur images dikhte hain (HTML aa gaya), lekin kuch click nahi hota kyunki JavaScript ab tak load nahi hui hoti. Phir jab JavaScript load ho ke React ko HTML ke saath connect karti hai aur sab interactive ho jata hai, us process ko hydration bolte hain. aur ye fibre algorithm k through kaafi achhi hoti hai

Reconciliation is the algorithm to compare two differing trees, and this is what popularly understood as "virtual DOM"

Hydration : When the page loads for the first time, then we see buttons and images (like HTML), but they are not clickable, because at that time javascript is not loaded. Then, when the javascript loads and connect React with HTML, and everything becomes interactive, then this process is known as hydration. And this is good enough with fibre algorithm.

**Common Interview Question**
If we have code like this -> setCounter(counter+1) four times, then the counter value will increase only by one

But if we have code like this -> setCounter(prevCounter => prevCounter + 1) four times, then the counter value will increase by 4 at a time or at a single click
